# Online-Learning-Platform
It is a project about an Online Learning Platform made in HTML and CSS.
It includes 7 web pages written in HTML and a CSS file for all pages.
The pages are: 
-Home/Pag_Principala 
-About Us 
-Profile 
-Course 
-Playlist 
-Teachers 
-Contact Us
contains the "index" page which is the Sign in, Sign up page
contains an "Images" archive with icons and images used in the code

Still Working:
-Database design
-Database implementation (using the code first approach)
-Creating the connection between the web application and the database (using Entity Framework)
-Testing the connection with the database using a Controller of an entity (CRUD operations on that table in the database)
-Implementation of all functionalities for at least 3 web pages
-Business logic for the application must be defined in services (a dedicated service for each of the entities used by the 3 web pages)
-Services must use the Repository Pattern to access the database (not to access directly from the Context)
-Application controllers must use services instead of the Context class
